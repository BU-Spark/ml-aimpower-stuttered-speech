## Project Overview
Our project is _Benchmarking Chinese Stuttered Speech Recordings Against Speech Recognition Models_. We aim at carrying out multilingual ASR model biases against Chinese stuttering phenomenons, quantifying the relationships between speech disabilities and performance of models. Our client is AImpower.org, specifically working with Dr. Shaomei Wu (shaomei@aimpower.org). This project is under DS549 the Spark! Machine Learning Practicum course.
